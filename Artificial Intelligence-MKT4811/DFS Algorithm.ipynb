A standard Depth-First Search implementation puts every vertex of the graph into one in all 2 categories: 1) Visited 2) Not Visited. The only purpose of this algorithm is to visit all the vertex of the graph avoiding cycles.\n","\n","The DSF algorithm follows as:\n","\n","1.   We will start by putting any one of the graph's vertex on top of the stack.\n","2.   After that take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list of the vertex.\n","3.   Next, create a list of that adjacent node of the vertex. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list of vertexes to the top of the stack.\n","4.   Lastly, keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.\n","\n","# DFS pseudocode\n","\n","\n","> The pseudocode for Depth-First Search in python goes as below: In the init() function, notice that we run the DFS function on every node because many times, a graph may contain two different disconnected part and therefore to make sure that we have visited every vertex, we can also run the DFS algorithm at every node.\n","\n","\n","\n","```\n","DFS(G, u)\n","\n","    u.visited = true\n","\n","    for each v ∈ G.Adj[u]\n","\n","        if v.visited == false\n","\n","            DFS(G,v)   \n","\n","init() {\n","\n","    For each u ∈ G\n","\n","        u.visited = false\n","\n","     For each u ∈ G\n","\n","       DFS(G, u)\n","\n","}\n","```\n","\n","# Example\n","\n","\n","> Let us see how the DFS algorithm works with an example. Here, we will use an undirected graph with 5 vertices.\n","\n","![Figure 1](https://favtutor.com/resources/images/uploads/mceu_98149160421608561023910.jpg)\n","\n","\n","1. We begin from the vertex P, the DFS rule starts by putting it within the Visited list and putting all its adjacent vertices within the stack.\n","\n","![Figure 2](https://favtutor.com/resources/images/uploads/mceu_90508131631608561076079.jpg)\n","\n","2. Next, we tend to visit the part at the highest of the stack i.e. Q, and head to its adjacent nodes. Since P has already been visited, we tend to visit R instead.\n","\n","![Figure 3](https://favtutor.com/resources/images/uploads/mceu_63122706741608561113514.jpg)\n","\n","\n","3. Vertex R has the unvisited adjacent vertex in T, therefore we will be adding that to the highest of the stack and visit it.\n","\n","![Figure 4](https://favtutor.com/resources/images/uploads/mceu_80233256851608561134124.jpg)\n","\n","![Figure 5](https://favtutor.com/resources/images/uploads/mceu_62821746971608561190080.jpg)\n","\n","4. At last, we will visit the last component S, it does not have any unvisited adjacent nodes, thus we've completed the Depth First Traversal of the graph.\n","\n","![Figure 6](https://favtutor.com/resources/images/uploads/mceu_62726748881608561211208.jpg)\n","\n","\n","# DFS Implementation in Python\n","\n","\n","\n","> Consider the following graph which is implemented in the code below:\n","\n","\n","![Figure 0](https://favtutor.com/resources/images/uploads/mceu_11416486411608560678558.jpg)\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"," \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"b_o8n5qB8oP4"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"kNcexb2R8luf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1666430348650,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":20,"user":{"displayName":"Ali İhsan Taş","userId":"00559405722093300208"}},"outputId":"87dd5d09-d2ce-4665-9ec5-5a4244212935"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Following is the Depth-First Search\n","5\n","3\n","2\n","4\n","8\n","7\n"]}],"source":["# Using a Python dictionary to act as an adjacency list\n","graph = {\n","  '5' : ['3','7'],\n","  '3' : ['2', '4'],\n","  '7' : ['8'],\n","  '2' : [],\n","  '4' : ['8'],\n","  '8' : []\n","}\n","\n","visited = set() # Set to keep track of visited nodes of graph.\n","\n","def dfs(visited, graph, node):  #function for dfs \n","    if node not in visited:\n","        print (node)\n","        visited.add(node)\n","        for neighbour in graph[node]:\n","            dfs(visited, graph, neighbour)\n","\n","# Driver Code\n","print(\"Following is the Depth-First Search\")\n","dfs(visited, graph, '5')"]}]}
